<!-- ### [Live Demo](https://www.example.com) -->

Welcome to **MovieGems**! A interactive movie watch list web app built to streamline your movie selection process. You can search for movies, add them to your movie watch list, and mark movies as watched once you watch them!

## ‚≠êÔ∏é Features

- **Search & Discover**: Powered by the OMDB API, this app allows you to search through an extensive database of movies. From classics and indie films, to the latest blockbusters.
- **Personal Watch list**: If you find a movie the intrigues you, add it to your watch list! Your movies are safely stored in MongoDB, ready to be viewed anytime.
- **Watched Movies**: Once you finish a movie, mark it as watched and it‚Äôll move to a separate list, so you can keep track of your movie-watching goals.
- **Dynamic Error Handling**: Errors are handled gracefully, whether it‚Äôs a missing movie poster or a network error, the app keeps running smoothly.
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete‚Äîmanage your watch list with ease. Add new movies, update their status to watched, or remove them entirely.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This app is built using the **MERN** stack, bringing together some of the most powerful web technologies:

- **MongoDB**: The database where your watch list lives.
- **Express.js**: Handles the server-side logic and routes.
