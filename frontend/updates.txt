MVP:

HIGH PRIORITY:
- Fix search error bug: when movie is not found, page freezes until refresh - possible solution = change from dynamic grid to seperate grids

- Make movie details dynamic: have 'add to watchlist' button only if the movie was a searched movie
- Optimize error and loading states
- Optimize UX:
	- add "are you sure you want to delete option" when users delete movie
	- show indicator (toast msg) when user adds a movie to their watch list
- Allow users to click "Mark as watched" button which will move movie from watchlist to a new list title "watched movies"
- Update design of homepage (it's really ugly rn)
- Make responsive
- Optimize navigation: fix issue with going back in browser (it does not go back to anticipated page)
- Deploy frontend and backend

Future updates:
- Add user login and authentication
- track user movie activity:
	- how movies they watch per year
	- how many hours of movies users watch
	- reccomended movies (using ML)
	- add social media features
	- allow collaborative movie watch list
